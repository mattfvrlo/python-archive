# fvrloAPI
![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/build-Hark,%20Triton,%20hark!-critical)

The fabled fvrloAPI, to automate all the silly tasks I need. I don't wanna keep copy-pasting lines of code. It hurts my hands.

## Included modules:
---
##### debug
> The famed debug function from debugModule. Print your data the better way!

##### block
> If your terminal supports UTF-8, this returns a block character. Otherwise you get a capital X. Sad.

##### getConcat
> Merge a list or strings together to one string, and if you don't want spaces, make the last string be 'nospace'.

##### getNewlines
> Get a list from one string, seperated every x characters.

##### edidGet
> Get a dictionary of your EDID registry (Windows only).

##### edidPrint
> Specially formatted print of edidGet's output.

##### regGet
> Get a dictionary of your main registry (Windows only).

##### regPrint
> Specially formatted print of regGet's output.

##### colortest/colorama
> Try out the color capabilities of the terminal, using [Colorama](https://pypi.org/project/colorama/) and some modified color names.
