# python-archive
The worst python scripts the world may ever dare to run. Mostly an archive of old scripts and assignments that I want saved for reference or otherwise.

Yes my whitespace is lacking. These were mostly rushed.

## hex.py
TKinter text editor that imports as hex codes and exports normally, effectively making the ugliest working hex code editor.

## debugModule
Just a quick importable module for printing debug info as you please in a nice format. It makes two columns. That's it really.

## YTDL
youtube-dl scripts in Windows Batch for automatically downloading HQ .wav files or mp4/mkv video files.
