The worst python scripts the world may ever dare to run. Mostly an archive of old scripts and assignments that I want saved for reference or otherwise, but slowly becoming a hub of quick DIY API's for things I do.

Yes my whitespace is lacking and my variable names are bad. I don't care.

### General Projects
---
##### fvrloAPI
> A collection of common python calls I make, made into one easy package. Eventually.


##### YTDL
> youtube-dl scripts in Windows Batch for automatically downloading HQ .wav files or mp4/mkv video files.


##### ASCII
> ASCII archive for neofetch and such.



### Individual scripts
---
#### hex.py
> TKinter text editor that imports as hex codes and exports normally, effectively making the ugliest working hex code editor.


#### shell.shl
> Custom Context Menu config for (moudey/shell)[https://github.com/moudey/shell]. Still learning it, so heavy WIP.
