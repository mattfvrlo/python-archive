# python-archive
The worst python scripts the world may ever dare to run. Mostly an archive of old scripts and assignments that I want saved for reference or otherwise.

Yes my whitespace is lacking. These were mostly rushed.

## hex.py
TKinter text editor that imports as hex codes and exports normally, effectively making the ugliest working hex code editor.

## shell.shl
Custom Context Menu config for [moudey/shell](https://github.com/moudey/shell). Still learning it, so heavy WIP.

## edidExport.py
EDID exporter for Windows machines, built in python and very very rough. It doesn't even work right now!

Many many thanks to [sewar/edid_grabber](https://github.com/sewar/edid_grabber) for almost all the bones of this one. I like EDID but I do not know how to get it.

## debugModule
Just a quick importable module for printing debug info as you please in a nice format. It makes two columns. That's it really.

## YTDL
youtube-dl scripts in Windows Batch for automatically downloading HQ .wav files or mp4/mkv video files.
